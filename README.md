# Machine-Learning-Classification-Program
This project was created to fulfill the brief assignment of Digital Skill Fair 36.0 Data Science organized by dibimbing.id.
I created a simple Machine Learning program, that is Iris Classification using the Decision Tree Algorithm. I used the Iris dataset from scikit-learn to build a decision tree classifier and visualized the tree structure. 

**What I Learn :**
1. Data Science Fundamental
2. Python (Libraries, Variables, and Data Types)
3. Machine Learning
4. Pandas
